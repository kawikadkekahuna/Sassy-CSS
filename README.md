# Intro to Sassy Media Queries

Build the SCSS file(s) that generate the following demo.

Level 1: Introduces media queries and scss structure. Use this [Sassy Blocks Demo](http://gomagames.com/blocks/blocks_sassy.html) for reference, though don't cheat and copy the CSS file!

Level 2: Now enhance the sassy blocks with a [Modular Grid](http://gomagames.com/blocks/blocks_sassy_modular.html).

Level 3: Now do some [nth-child styling](http://gomagames.com/blocks/blocks_sassy_modular_nth.html) for fun.

## Instructions:

1.  Set up a [Gulp + Livereload + Sass Project](https://gist.github.com/kellishouts/2c7cde625491ad53fb3c)

2.  Use this [Starter index.html File](https://gist.github.com/kellishouts/b54653caac83c6ad7713). Typically, you would whiteboard and build this yourself.

3.  Use this [Starter styles.scss File](https://gist.github.com/kellishouts/f40214cf8dcce1b5c4f9). Media query ranges, font mixin & some variables are defined for you. Typically, you have to build all of this on your own.

4.  Style the project to use
    - inline media queries
    - font mixin
    - variables

5.  Make sure your stylesheet uses a mobile-first approach. (Define all styles for all sizes, then override medium, then large styles).
